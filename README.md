# Smartcouch
This is a small project called smartcouch. With this project I'm tracking my development of a small REST based API running on a Raspberry Pi including the wiring with additional hardware like LED stripes. Beside the code I'm also including instructions and manuals on building the couch itself.

The following hardware is needed to build the couch:
- Raspberry Pi (incl. Power supply, SD card, Wifi dongle, ...)
- LED stripes WS2801
- 5V 12A Power Supply (for LEDs)
- 3 Euro Pallets
